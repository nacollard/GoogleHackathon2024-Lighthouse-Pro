## Prequisites
You need to have a service-account-key.json file that has the permission to use VertexAI API in the root of the project. You can get it by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started


## Installation

First, you need to install node.js through this link https://nodejs.org/en/download
```bash
# Follow those instructions to launch Lighthouse Pro.
git clone https://github.com/nacollard/GoogleHackathon2024-Lighthouse-Pro
cd GoogleHackathon2024-Lighthouse-Pro
npm install
npm run start
```

## Usage
```bash
# Launch Lighthouse Pro with your index.js file & the url of your website.
node index.js <<your_website_url>> <<path_to_codebase>>
```

## Features
1.  **Get a report on the top 5 problems detected by Lighthouse**
2.  **Parse the webpages of Google's advices shared through links in Lighthouse**
3.  **Recieve improvement instructions through the terminal based on your codebase**

**TO COME**
1. **Expanded Lighthouse Pro Functionality**:
   - **Caching for Speed**: Implement a caching mechanism to store and quickly deliver Lighthouse reports, significantly reducing wait times for performance insights.
   - **Cloud Service Integrations**: Build seamless integrations with various cloud services, allowing developers to incorporate Lighthouse Pro into their cloud-based workflows effortlessly.
   - **LLM Prioritization Agent**: Include a language model-based prioritization agent that intelligently assesses and ranks issues based on their potential impact, enabling you to tackle the most critical performance bottlenecks first.

2. **Automated Lighthouse Problem Resolution**:
   - **Code Generation**: Integrate code generation capabilities to automatically propose and apply fixes for issues identified by Lighthouse, streamlining the optimization process.
   - **Recursive Optimization**: Employ a recursive approach to continuously improve the Lighthouse score by iteratively applying optimizations and re-evaluating performance.
   - **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure that Lighthouse Pro is a part of the CI/CD pipeline, automatically running performance checks and optimizations with every code push to maintain high-quality code standards.

3. **Integration with Developer Tools**:
   - **Go Compilation Bug Solver**: Offer tools to automatically detect and resolve bugs in Go language compilations, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of the development process.
   - **Kubernetes Cluster Deployment**: Provide features to facilitate the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters, simplifying the orchestration of containerized applications.
   - **Google Cloud Cost Optimization**: Include functionality to analyze and optimize costs for projects running on Google Cloud Platform, helping developers to minimize expenses while maximizing resource utilization.
